# Contributing to the TASVideos Site

Welcome! The TASVideos staff have set up links here to help guide new developers toward contributing to the code behind the TASVideos website.

## Directing Contributions

Please feel free to file issues for any bugs observed! The maintainers will aim to confirm and mark them with a milestone based on their severity. We also welcome creating PRs directly if the solution is readily available and a maintainer will review the pull request and merge it. Developers who submit more complex or frequent PRs are encouraged to join the [site discord](http://tasvideos.org/DiscordServer.html) and ask for a site developer role. Any contributions will be [licensed under GPL v3](License).

## Code of Conduct

Contributors are expected to uphold a basic [code of conduct](CODE_OF_CONDUCT) in all interactions inside and outside of the project.

## Developer Setup

See [Local Development Setup](README#local-development-setup) in the readme for instructions on running the site locally for development.

## Code Style

The codebase uses the K&R indentation style of placing braces on their own line at the same level of indentation as their header function. It uses tabs for indentation including in HTML in CSHTML where it acts as a single space when parsed by web browsers. Otherwise, code style should generally follow conventions for .NET 5 and C#.

## Site Design

The site has a [design document](DESiGN-SPEC) which details the structure, philosophy, and design goals of the frontend segments of the codebase which is great study for aspiring frontend contributors.
