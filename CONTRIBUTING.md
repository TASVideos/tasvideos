# Contributing to the TASVideos Site

Welcome! The TASVideos staff have set up links here to help guide new developers toward contributing to the code behind the TASVideos website.

## Directing Contributions

Please feel free to file issues for any bugs observed! The maintainers will aim to confirm and mark them with a milestone based on their severity. We also welcome creating PRs directly if the solution is readily available and a maintainer will review the pull request and merge it. Developers who submit more complex or frequent PRs are encouraged to join the [site discord](https://tasvideos.org/LiveChat) and ask for a site developer role. Any contributions will be [licensed under GPL v3](LICENSE).

If a security issue is found please instead follow our [security policy](SECURITY.md) to disclose the issue.

## Code of Conduct

Contributors are expected to uphold a basic [code of conduct](CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md) in all interactions inside and outside of the project.

## Developer Setup

See [Local Development Setup](https://github.com/TASVideos/tasvideos/wiki/Local-Development-Setup) in the readme for instructions on running the site locally for development.

## Code Style

The codebase uses the [Allman style](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indentation_style#Allman_style), placing braces on their own line. It uses tabs for indentation including in HTML in CSHTML where it acts as a single space when parsed by web browsers. Otherwise, code style should generally follow conventions for .NET 5 and C#.

## Site Design

The site has a [design document](DESIGN-SPEC.md) which details the structure, philosophy, and design goals of the frontend segments of the codebase which is great study for aspiring frontend contributors.
