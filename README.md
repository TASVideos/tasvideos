# TASVideos 2.0
This is a rewrite attempt of the tasvideos website.

It aims to change technologies, have simpler more maintainable code, and bring the site up to modern standards.

Goals of this rewrite include:
- Ability to run as Https/SSL (http redirects to https)
- Address multi-lingual issues
- Responsive design/mobile friendly
- Ability to be a Site Admin without db access or coding experience
- Maintainable
- Architectured in a way that can facilitate major site changes as the needs of the community change
- Ability to run on Linux in production
- Ability to run on any OS in a local development environment
- Feature parity
- Ability to host GDQ TAS content
- Ability to store and facilitate console verification knowledge and verification data/files

A demo server has been set up for this project:
https://demo.tasvideos.org/

This demo updates with production days once a day, and updates with the latest code twice a day.

# Local Development Setup

## Prerequisites
- .NET Core 5.0 SDK
- VSCode or VS recommended for best development experience
- MSSQL from VS or postgres installed for the local database

## Quick-Start Instructions

### Visual Studio (Windows)
- Install Visual Studio Community 2019 from https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/
- Run Visual Studio installer
- Select the following:
