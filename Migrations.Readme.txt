To add a migration:
First you must have EF cli installed (run dotnet ef to check)
Go to the PackageManagerConsole (or powershell window)
Make sure you are in the solution directory
dotnet ef migrations add [NameOfMigration] --project TASVideos.Data --startup-project TASVideos

Migration Best practices:
Always inspect your migration to see if it could result in data loss!
Never remove a column or table in the same release as you remove references for it.
	-Remove all references to the table or column first and release
	-Then add a migration that removes the dead column/table
	-This will ensure there is no moment during the deploy where new code code is referencing an old database or vice versa
